How to make a Dabuntu Live CD. Not all steps need to be done in the specified
order. Time-permitting, it would be great to automate all these steps but for
now this is what we have.

+ Download a live cd image iso from the Ubuntu website.

+ Download reconstructor and run it against the downloaded iso. Check all
  boxes to do the one-time creations of the various image structures.

+ copy dabo*.desktop to <reconstructor>/root/usr/share/applications

+ copy 97dabo to <reconstructor>/initrd/scripts/casper-bottom and make sure
  it is executable (chmod 755, for example)

+ Get the latest dabo, daboide, and dabodemo tarballs, and extract to 
  <reconstructor>/root/usr/lib. You should have directories /usr/lib/dabo,
  etc.

+ Grab the webtest.sqlite file and save to /usr/lib/dabo-sqlite.db

+ copy dabo.pth to <reconstructor>/root/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages

+ copy sources.list to <reconstructor>/root/etc/apt, replacing the existing
  one (or manually add the wxpython starship entries)

+ Download the Dabo Runtime Installer for Windows, and place in 
  <reconstructor>/remaster/programs/dabo/

+ Start reconstructor again, not checking any boxes, and not specifying 
  the input iso. Or, perhaps reconstructor is still running, which is just
  fine. When it is done starting up, click on the Terminal button on the 
  bottom.

  + apt-get update
  + apt-get install python-mysqldb
  + apt-get install python-pysqlite2
  + apt-get install python-wxgtk2.6 python-wxtools wx2.6-i18n

  + It is necessary to remove some stuff, unfortunately, to stay within 
    the size limitations of CD-R's.

    + apt-get remove gimp openoffice.org openoffice.org2 gaim ekiga evolution
    + apt-get autoclean
    + apt-get clean

+ Exit the Reconstructor terminal and go back to the reconstructor gtk
  window, to the "Software" tab. Click on "Software Removal" and check all
  the boxes. I have no idea why this results in more savings than the
  apt-get remove operations above, but it does. Press "Apply".

+ Press "Next" button. Change the CD description appropriately
  as whatever you put there will be very visible to the user. Press
  "Finish" and wait forever (make a sandwich or two), crossing your 
  fingers that your iso won't be too big for the cd. If it turns out it 
  is, you can remove the win32 setup files or manually delete stuff 
  from <reconstructor>/root.

+ Use your cd recorder to burn the custom iso and do a test-boot. Start
  figuring out what art project to make out of all your coasters. ;)

+ The cd label was done in OpenOffice.org, if you want to use it as
  a template... *.odg.
