I don't remember exactly what I did to generate the sphinx docs, so I grepped
the machine's history file, and pulled out all of the relvant lines that look
like they might do something.

/usr/local/bin/sphinx-build -c /home/ed/projects/dabodoc/api/sphinx/source -b html -D graphviz_dot="/usr/bin/dot" /home/ed/projects/dabodoc/api/sphinx/source /home/ed/projects/dabodoc/api/sphinx/build/html

sphinx-build 

cd ~/projects/dabodoc/api/sphinx/
sphinx-quickstart 

sphinx-build -c . -b html source build/html/
sphinx-build -ac . -b html source build/html/

sphinx-build --version
