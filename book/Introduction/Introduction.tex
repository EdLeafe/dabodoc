% \section{Summary}

% Dabo is a framework built on Python that provides a clean API for developers to 
%build data-aware business applications that are cross-platform. In addition to this 
%underlying framework, Dabo also provides some power tools, such as a visual UI 
%designer based on wxGlade, for designing and laying out your forms, menus, and 
% other UI elements, and wizards and demo applications for getting started. These 
% power tools are discussed elsewhere in this book.
